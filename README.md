## Project Description

This is a personal project aiming to build a production ready to-do app. Since a to-do app is easy to build, it would be a good start to get more familiar to the latest dev tools.

In addition, I will create the app from scratch using LLM agents, let's see if they are capable of building a production ready app. 

Lastly, I would like to implement some new ideas on the to-do app, make it easier to use by using LLM's power.

## Note

While most parts of the app will be built by LLM, I will write this README by myself so that I can express my ideas clearly.
